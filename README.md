# Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis

This project is a part of job simulation that I just completed **Accenture North America's Data Analytics and Visualization on Forage**.

In the simulation I:
 * Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
   
 * Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions.
   
 * Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.


This journey has deepened my understanding of how data can drive impactful business decisions. I’m grateful for the opportunity to enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and communication.

A big thanks to **Forage** and **Accenture** for providing this amazing platform to bridge the gap between learning and real-world application!
